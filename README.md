# Letterboxed Solver

This is a project I wrote to learn rust and the statig library.

## Usage
Find a [letterboxed](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/letter-boxed) puzzle

```
cargo build --release
./target/release/letterboxed
```

If the 4 sides of the puzzle are ["abc", "def", "uvw", "xyz], when prompted, enter `abcdefuvwxyz`
